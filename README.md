# JAVA-Sport-Shop-project
I have done this project with the help of oops concepts.
I have used Encapsulation, inheritance, Switch cases, nested Switch also other methods.
Encapsulation- It is the process of binding states and behaviour of an object.
Encapsulation is used for hiding tha data.
Data hiding- Data hiding means avoiding direct access but providing controlled access .
Data hiding is done with the help of private access specifier.
For encapsulation we have to use getter and setter methods.
Inheritance- the process of child class acquiring all the states and behaviours of parent class is known as Inheritance.
Inheritance is done with the help of "Extends" and "Implements" keyword.
Types of Inheritance- 1)SIngle level Inheritance 2)Multi level Inheritance 3)Hierarchical Inheritance 4)Multiple Inheritance 5)Hybrid Inheritance.
